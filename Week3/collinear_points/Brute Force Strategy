Brute Force Strategy
Going through all points in different groups of 4
N⁴
* Loop 1st i (start i)
* Loop 2nd j (start i+1)
* Loop 3rd k (start j+1)
* Loop 4th l (start k+1)

* check if slope(i, j) == slope(i, k) == slope(i, l)
* if so -> add to line segment vector vector<LineSegment> as point -> sort 4 points from lower to upper in terms of < (position -> mergeSort)
* continue looping

No problem: never more than 4 colinear points
