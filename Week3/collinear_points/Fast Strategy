Fast Strategy

N2LogN + N2
For each point p:
* Sort all other points given slope they make with p (NlogN with merge sort)
  	* Creates a sorted vector with points
	* Find all the adjacent points with same slope. Record min/max points according to less than operator, useful for 4 or more points with same slope.
	* If 4 or more collinear points, add to segments.
